# pre-releases

A location to publish pre-release binaries, for testing purposes.

The binaries are grouped by tag names:

- [test](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/tag/test) - as final as possible, to be tested on all platforms before publishing
- [experimental](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/tag/experimental) - for early tests; partial functionality, sometimes possibly broken
